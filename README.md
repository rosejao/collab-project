## Final Project

# Project Description


# Technical Description

We will be using several libraries to wrangle the data and make sure we can present our findings in a presentable manner. The first library we will be using is dplyr.  Also, we will use ggplot2 to plot our data and have it be interactive. Furthermore, we will use shiny to let users interact with our findings.  

I believe it will be hard to find the features that we will let users filter on. This will entirely depend on what kinds of information we are trying to convey. Since we can derive many different insights from this large dataset, we will have to spend some time agreeing upon the best approach. Another aspect that could cause some problems is how exactly we want to present each insight. Since our dataset has a lot of location specific data, displaying an interactive map could make sense, but if we cannot derive much information from it then it would be pointless.
